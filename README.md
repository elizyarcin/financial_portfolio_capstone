Capstone Project: Stock Portfolio RecommendationÂ¶

1. Project Description and Objective
I am working as a wealth manager at a small firm where I have clients seeking advice on how to invest their money.
A young client wants to invest a large amount of their savings in a portfolio of stocks, but they are unsure of what stocks to invest in and at what amounts.

In this capstone project, I will create a presentation that showcases a portfolio of stocks that I recommend the client invest in, and provide the weights at which they should invest in each stock depending on their risk preference.

The purpose of this capstone is to practice accessing and downloading financial data, calculating financial statistics to understand the individual performance of an asset and how groups of assets are related, and how to allocate investments across assets for optimal performance.
